You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel alright?

Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And hell yeah, I'm the motherfucking princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right

She's, like, so whatever
You can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again
(And again and again and again)

So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Or, better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again
(And again and again and again)

Because she's, like, so whatever
You can do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about

In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

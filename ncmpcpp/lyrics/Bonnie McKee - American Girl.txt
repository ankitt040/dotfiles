I fell in love in a 7-Eleven parkin' lot
Sat on the curb drinkin' slurpees we mixed with alcohol
We talked about all our dreams and how we would show 'em all (whoa)

I told him I got a plan and I'm gonna dominate
And I don't need any man to be getting in my way
But if you talk with your hands then we can negotiate

I'll just keep movin' my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

I am an American girl
Hot-blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world
Hot-blooded all American girl (whoa)

I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition 
Put the key into my ignition (oh way oh)

I wanna see all the stars and everything in between 
I wanna buy a new heart out of a vending machine
'Cuz it's a free country so baby we can do anything (whoa)

I'll just keep movin' my body (yeah)
I'm always ready to party (yeah)
No I don't listen to mommy (yeah)
And I'll never say that I'm sorry

I am an American girl
Hot-blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world
Hot-blooded all American girl (whoa)

I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition 
Put the key into my ignition (oh way oh)

You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright)
Oh baby gonna go all night (Oh we're gonna go all night)
You know we're gonna shine so bright (Oh we're gonna shine so bright)
Oh baby gonna go all night

I am an American girl
Hot-blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world (I'm takin' over)
Hot-blooded all American girl

I am an American girl

I was raised by a television
Every day is a competition 
Put the key into my ignition (oh way oh)

I am an American girl
Hot-blooded and I'm ready to go
I'm lovin' takin' over the world (I'm takin' over)

I am an American girl

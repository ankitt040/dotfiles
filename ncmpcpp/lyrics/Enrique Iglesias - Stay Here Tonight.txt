I know its late and you're tired and we've been talking for hours here
You don't have to tell me
I see that look in your eyes and I know soon we'll say A goodbye, so, yeah
I feel it coming
And I hear you take a deep breath
And my hands are starting to sweat
I don't want you to
I don't want you to leave, yeah
Stay here tonight
Stay here tonight
Cause when you're around me everythings right
Don't go, oh, don't leave me alone
Stay here tonight
Stay here tonight
I wanna hold you in my arms, show you what thats like
Don't go, I need you, I need you
You grab your coat and I'm dying
But I know that your still deciding, yeah
Cause nobody's moving
Time stops and everythings quiet, I'm hanging on for my life in you
You don't even see it
And then you coming closer
And baby its not over
Till I hear you say

Something about you makes me feel like I'm alive

I don't wanna see your face again
You messed up, ain't that a shame
You talk the talk then walk away
Can't trust a word you say
Are you ever gonna make a change?
Are you ever gonna mend your ways?
Ain't nothing but a thin disguise
Your crying, lying eyes

Tell me, where were you last night?
Always give yourself an alibi
You walk the walk with no goodbye
Out of sight means out of mind
I'm seriously hating you
I'm sick and tired of the things you do
Ain't nothing but a thin disguise
Your crying, lying eyes

I gotta take this moment
To look into your own dark mind and read the signs (yeah)
Do you finally see it?
Go heal the wounds or scars will remain for life

So I gotta try and win the fight
Man in the mirror screams change your life
Drop the act, mamma raised you right
I no longer wanna be that guy
I'm seriously out of line
As a lover I'm a waste of time
Ain't nothing but a thin disguise
Your crying, lying eyes

And nobody sees this
And nobody sees the hurting deep inside
If you look a bit closer
There's a man who's been afraid to cry

And nobody sees this
And nobody sees the hurting deep inside
If you look a bit closer
There's a man who's been afraid to cry

Your crying, lying eyes

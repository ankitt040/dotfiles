You think you’re smart
I know you’re not
You think you’ve got it
Well I think not
Your Gucci bag
Don’t look too real
So you know how it is
But do you know how it feels?

Today you’re standing tall
But I know your heels are high
Pretty scent, I know it ain’t Chanel no. 5
Eye on the prize, dressed up for the kill
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels?

You’re just a fake
You’re unreal
Name your price, make the deal
And you don’t care what you take
You’re a fake
You’re just a fake and a fraud
A wannabe in Dior
And you have no heart to break
You’re a fake

You think you’re sharp
You think you’re hot
Your made up face
Don’t hide your spots
You drive around in hired wheels
So you know how it is
But you don’t know how it feels

I wouldn’t look so proud
You haven’t got it all
You haven’t got the heart
You haven’t got the balls
Lost in your lies
In it for the thrill
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels?

When you’re a fake
You’re unreal
Name your price, make the deal
And you don’t care what you take

You’re a fake
You’re just a fake and a fraud
A wannabe in Dior
And you have no heart to break
You’re a fake

(Fake) you think you’re cool
(We know you’re not)
You think you’ve got it
(But we say not)
You drive around
(In hired wheels)
So you know how it is
But, do you know how it feels?
Woh-oh-oh-oh
Do you know how it feels?

You’re just a fake
You’re unreal
Name your price, make the deal
And you don’t care what you take
You’re a fake
You’re just a fake and a fraud
A wannabe in Dior
And you have no heart to break
You’re a fake

I know I said something, I didn't mean to last night
nother rocky mend, outta something so light
ou said that you would leave, with a tear in your eye
         
           I lie so selfishly, I feel asleep to your crys

I woke up to your photograph 
Reminded me of all the silly things we did that made us laugh
Wish we were right back where, we fell in love without a care
I let you get away 
Away from me
I'm broken and afraid
I'm on my knees

You been away for days, I wonder where could you be
I can't imagine life, without you and me
Your photos fading fast, from my memory 
Can you forget the past, and come on home to me

I cry, it's time I fall to sleep
I wake up nights and call your name out loud and hope that your where with me
And something in the darkest nights, I wish that I could hold you tight
I let you get away 
Away from me
I'm broken and afraid 
I'm on my knees 

Baby come to me, baby can't you see 
Got a deep burning love that's inside 
I let you get away 
Away from me

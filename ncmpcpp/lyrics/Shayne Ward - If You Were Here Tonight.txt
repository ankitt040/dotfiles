Can't you understand it?
Girl, you know how much I care

As the night moves in
Love takes on new meaning
If you were here
You would know what I mean to say
The circumstance leaves me
Only waiting for the chance
I only want to love you more, more

Can't you understand it?
Girl, you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it
If you could only know my feelings
You would know how much I do believe
If you were here tonight by my side
If you were with me now

When the lights go out, I cannot pretend
This bed's too big oh for me
To be in alone, oh all alone

Can't you understand it?
Girl, you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it
No no no no no no
If you could only know my feelings
You would know how much I do believe
If you were here tonight, oh night
By my side if you were with me now

Every night alone I just wait here anticipating
For the day I won't feel this pain, baby
Please don't keep me waiting
Come to me, if you were here tonight
Ooh girl, be by my side
If you were with me now
This bed's too big oh for me
To be in alone, oh all alone

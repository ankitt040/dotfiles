Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free

You got me trippin'
And it feels like a shock to my system
Didn't think it existed
And now I know that it's true
Yes I do

And now I'm on a mission
Because you made me see 
That it's not impossible
That someone just like you
Could be with me
Yes you could  

[CHORUS]
Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying
To keep my cool
It's hard you see
When you're next to me

Baby it was you that was missing
I never knew the truth
'Til my heart told me
That something was different
So I listened for the first time
Yes I did

It's a new kind of feeling
You take me to a place
That I ain't been
When you touch me
It's magic
When you touch me
Yes it is

[CHORUS]
Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying
To keep my cool
It's hard you see
When you're next to me Baby
Next to me Baby
Come on

Feels like the first time
Every time that you look at me
And I have to try
And get a grip on reality
People say this and they say that
But baby it's hard to see
When you're next to me
Baby come on

[CHORUS]
Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying
To keep my cool
It's hard you see
When you're next to me baby
Next to me baby come on

[CHORUS] 
Feels like the first time for me
One touch and you set me free
It's like you're out of my league
And though I'm trying
To keep my cool
It's hard you see
When you're next to me baby
Next to me
Baby 
Come on

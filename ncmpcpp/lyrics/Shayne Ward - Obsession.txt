Baby, baby
What can I do
I need to know, that
I belong, belong with you
Yea with you

Baby baby
What can I say
The more you play those wicked games,
The more I stay, the more I stay

Teacher be concerned, I want it so
Bad right now it hurts
Cause I, I, I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I, I, I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I'm in obession (twice)

Baby baby, don't make me wait.
I only want, to give up air,
Breathe you instead, you instead
Baby, baby just ring the bell
And I'll be stayin' after class
Under your spell, yea your spell

Teacher be concerned,
I don't think, my lessons been learnt

Cause I, I, I'm more than in love
Baby I'm In obsession
I, I, I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
Baby this, in love, it's an obsession
Baby this, in love, it's an obsession (session [x6])

I, I, I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
I, I, I'm more than in love
Baby I'm in obsession
Baby this, in love, it's an obsession
Baby this, in love, it's an obsession

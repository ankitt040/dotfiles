This. One. Is for you.
This. One. Is for you.

Girl when I close my eyes
I realise
I don't know what I'd do without your loving
And I can't hold it any longer

Now I see you and me
All the way
And to prove it i will make a promise
That i will never leave you lonely

And if you fall
I will stand by your side
When you got no where to run
Baby i'm a place to hide
One for my lover,
One for my sister,
One for my brother
Soon you'll discover its true
This ones for you

There comes a time in your life
When you must
Take a long hard look into the mirror
You see its so much clearer

And if you fall
I will stand by your side
When you got no where to run
Baby i'm a place to hide
One for my lover,
One for my sister,
One for my brother
Soon you'll discover its true
This ones for you

I ain't gonna give you up
Gonna give you all my love
Even if it all falls down
Baby I'm still around
Baby i'm still around

And if you fall
I will stand by your side
When you got no where to run
Baby i'm a place to hide
One for my lover,
One for my sister,
One for my brother
Soon you'll discover its true
This ones for you

There from the start
You gave to me all I need
What a fool I've been
But I found it hard
To give to you all of me
Don't end it, please

If only I'd seen
You were right there for me
You were my drive and my fight
The push in the right direction
You were perfection

Now that I need you, you gotta stay
Now that I love you, you can't walk away
Never a heart could be so true
I didn't find you 'til there was too much to lose

Baby, if I
Had the chance to make you believe
My, my energy

Oh, why couldn't I see
What was in front of me
You were my drive and my fight
The push in the right direction
You were perfection

Now that I need you, you gotta stay
Now that I love you, you can't walk away
All of my hope would disappear
I would be lost without you here

Now that I want you back in my life
I promise you it's all worth the fight
Never a heart could be so true
I didn't find you 'til there was too much to lose

Hush baby, listen, listen to me
I need to tell you what you mean to me
You're my everything, just give me a chance to prove now

Now that I need you, you gotta stay
Now that I love you, you can't walk away
All of my hope would disappear
I would be lost without you here, so lost

Now that I want you back in my life
I promise you it's all worth the fight
Never a heart could be so true
I didn't find you 'til there was too much to lose
Never a heart could be so true
Now that I've found you, girl, we've got too much to lose
